These are my notes that I presented to the HPC users at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

It is short and incomplete.
It is directed at users with minimal Linux experience.

This presentation covers : 
1. Environmental variables and their usage in managing software.
    * Focuses primarily on `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. 
2. Modules
    * Show's how modules change the environmental variable
3. Libraries
    * Does an example to illustrate how shared libraries work and how to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. 
4. Startup scripts like `.bashrc` and `.profile`
